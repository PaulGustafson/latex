\opening{To the Hiring Committee:}

Diversity is in my blood.  My mother is from India, my father from Maryland. As a person of mixed ethnicity, I am in a unique position to mediate between cultures. I have always striven to be a bridge between worlds, even in my own family. 
As a child, I was sometimes forced to mediate between my mother and my father's family.  Not only was there a cultural barrier, my mother is also a diagnosed schizophrenic.  However, I am also privileged in many ways.  My father is a math professor.  Both of my parents have post-graduate degrees.

As an undergraduate at both Princeton and Texas A\&M University, I also strove to be a bridge between worlds.  At Princeton, I volunteered to tutor underprivileged kids in Trenton.  At Texas A\&M, I was a camp counselor at a summer camp to introduce high schoolers, particularly students from underprivileged backgrounds, to mathematical research.  In both cases, talking about math with the kids and just spending time with them had a visible motivating influence on both them and me.

As a graduate teaching assitant, I have striven to encourage students from underprivileged backgrounds to actively participate in class.  Each semester, I encourage everyone to ask questions, no matter how basic.  I actively try to include everyone in class discussions, especially struggling students and students from underprivileged backgrounds.

I am committed to recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups in mathematics, both in collaborative research and in teaching. Everyone should have the opportunity to learn and participate in mathematics, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, personality, and socioeconomic and educational background.


\closing{Sincerely yours,\\ Paul Gustafson \\ Texas A\&M University}
