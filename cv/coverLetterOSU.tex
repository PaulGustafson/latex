\opening{To the Hiring Committee:}

My name is Paul Gustafson. I am a graduate student at Texas A\&M University, working in the areas of quantum algebra and quantum topology. I expect to receive a Ph.D. from Texas A\&M in May 2018, under the direction of Eric Rowell. I would like to apply for a postdoctoral position in your department.

I am particular interested in working with Thomas Kerler and Dave Penneys. My paper on mapping class group representations from twisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theory answers a question that Thomas Kerler had previously discussed with a postdoc.  Moreover, my research in the classification of modular tensor categories should be of interest to both Thomas and Dave.

With my application, I include the standard AMS cover letter, a curriculum
vitae, a research statement, and a teaching statement. I will also have five
letters of recommendation sent. There will be research letters from
Eric Rowell (rowell@math.tamu.edu), Thomas Kerler (kerler.2@osu.edu), Richard Ng (rng@math.lsu.edu), and Zhenghan Wang (zhengwa@math.ucsb.edu) and one teaching letter from Peter Howard (phoward@math.tamu.edu).

Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide. Thank you in
advance for your consideration.

\closing{Sincerely yours,\\ Paul Gustafson \\ Texas A\&M University}
