\p{16.3} Orbits: $\{1,2,3,4\}, \{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\}, \{m_1, m_2\}, \{d_1, d_2\},
\{C\}, \{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\}$.
\p{16.12}  Let $g,h \in G_Y$. If $y \in Y$, then $ghy = gy = y$ and $g^{-1}y = g^{-1}(gy) = y$.
\p{16.13} \textbf{a.} If $x \in \R^2$, then the action of $0$ on $x$ leaves $x$ fixed by definition.  For the associative property, write $x = (r,\theta)$ in polar form.  Then $\alpha(\beta * x) = (r, \theta + \beta + \alpha) 
= (\alpha +\beta) * x$.

\textbf{b.} The orbit containing $P$ is the circle centered at the origin passing through $P$.

\textbf{c.} $G_P = 2\pi(\Z,+)$, since $\theta$ fixes $P$ iff $\theta = 2\pi n$ for some $n \in \Z$.

\p{17.2} $G$ is the direct product of $\langle (1 3) \rangle$ and $\langle (2 4 7) \rangle$ since these cycles are disjoint.  Hence, $|G| = (2)(3) = 6$.
By Corollary 17.2, the number of orbits is $(1/6)(2*3 + 3*2 + 3*6) = 5$. An easier way would be to just count the orbits directly.

\p{17.4} As mentioned in the section, the group of rotations of the cube has 24 elements. If we fix an orientation of the cube with a distinguished face and neighboring face, each rotation can be described by the 6 choices for the first face and then 4 choices for the neighboring face.
