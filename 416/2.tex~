\p{27.18} Is $\Q[x]/(x^2 - 5x + 6)$ a field? Why?
\begin{proof}
No, $x-2$ and $x-3$ are zero divisors.
\end{proof}
\p{27.19} Is $K := \Q[x]/(x^2 - 6x + 6)$ a field? Why?
\begin{proof}
Yes, $x^2 -6x + 6$ is irreducible over $\Q$ by Eisenstein's criterion ($p=2$). Hence, $\langle p(x)\rangle$ is maximal by Theorem 27.25. Hence, $K$ is a field.
\end{proof}
\p{27.30} Prove that if $F$ is a field, every proper nontrivial prime ideal of $F[x]$ is maximal.
\begin{proof} 
Let $N \subset F[x]$ be a proper nontrivial prime ideal of $F[x]$. By Theorem 27.24, $N$ is principal; let $p(x)$ be a generator of $N$. 

To see that $p(x)$ is irreducible, suppose $ p(x) = q(x) r(x)$ for $q,r$ of degree less than $p$.  Then since $N = \langle p(x) \rangle$ is a prime ideal, either $q$ or $r$ is a multiple of $p$. This contradicts the assumption that both $q$ and $r$ have degree less than $p$. Hence, $p(x)$ is irreducible. Hence, since $N \ne 0$, Theorem 27.25 implies $N$ is maximal.
\end{proof}
\p{27.33} Use the fact that, for any field $F$, $F[x]$ is a PID to show TFAE:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every nonconstant polynomial in $\C[x]$ has a zero in $\C$.
\item Let $f_1(x), \ldots, f_r(x) \in \C[x]$ and suppose that every $\alpha \in \C$ that is a zero of all $r$ of these polynomials is also a zero of a polynomial $g(x)$ in $\C[x]$. Then some power of $g(x)$ is in the smallest ideal of $\C[x]$ that contains the $r$ polynomials $f_1(x), \ldots, f_r(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
Suppose (1) holds. Then all the $f_i$ split over $\C$.
\end{proof}
\p{29.30} Let $E$ be an extension field of a finite field $F$, where $F$ has $q$ elements. Let $\alpha \in E$ be algebraic over $F$ of degree $n$. Prove that $F(\alpha)$ has $q^n$ elements.
\begin{proof}
This follows immediately from Theorem 29.18, which says that $F(\alpha)$ is an $n$ dimensional vector space over $F$. Each coordinate has $q$ choices, so there are $q^n$ total elements in $F(\alpha)$.
\end{proof}
\p{29.31}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that there exists an irreducible polynomial of degree $3$ in $\Z_3[x]$.
\item Show from part (1) that there exists a finite field of 27 elements. (Hint: use 30)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
Let $p(x) = x^3 - x + 1$. Since $p$ has no roots in $\Z_3$, it cannot have linear factors, so must be irreducible. Part 2 follows directly from 30.
\end{proof}
\p{29.34} Show that $S := \{a + b(\sqrt[3] 2) + c(\sqrt[3] 2)^2 | a,b,c \in \Q\}$ is a subfield of $\R$ by using Theorem 29.18.
\begin{proof}
By Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$, $x^3 - 2$ is irreducible over $\Q$. Hence, since $\sqrt[3] 2$ is of degree 3 over $\Q$, Theorem 29.18 states that the elements of $Q[\sqrt[3] 2]$ are precisely the elements of $S$.
\end{proof}
