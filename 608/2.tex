\subsection*{HW 2}
\p{1} Let $X, Y$ be normed spaces and $T: X \to Y$ be a bounded linear operator.  We define $T^*: Y^* \to X^*$ as $T^*(f) = f \circ T$. Show that $T^*$ is a well-defined bounded linear operator and $\|T^*\| = \|T\|$.

\begin{proof}
If $f \in Y^*$, then $f \circ T: X \to \R$, so $T^*$ is a well-defined linear map. To see that it is bounded, we have $\|T(f)\| = \|f \circ T\| \le \|f\| \|T\|$.
\end{proof}


\p 2 Let $f : [-\pi, \pi] \to \R$ be a continuous function. Use the Uniform boundedness theorem to show that there exists $f$ continuous such that its fourier series does not converge at $t_0 = 0$. %See hint.
\begin{proof}
Let $a_n \in (C[-\pi, \pi])^*$ be defined by $a_n(f) = \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) e^{-inx} dx$, the $n$-th Fourier coefficient for $f$. Let $\phi_N(f) = \sum_{n \le N} a_n(f) = \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) D_N(x) \,dx$, where $D_N = \sum_{n\le N} e^{inx}$ is the $N$-th Dirichlet kernel. Then $\phi_N(f)$ is the $N$-th partial sum of the Fourier series of $f$ evaluated at $0$. By the uniform boundedness principle, it suffices to show that $(\|\phi_N\|)_N$ is unbounded.

Pick $(f_n) \subset C[-\pi, \pi]$ with $f_n \to \sgn(D_N)$ in $L_1$.  Then $\phi_N(f_n) = \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f_N D_N \,dx = \frac 1 {2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi  |D_N| + (f_n - \sgn(D_N)) D_N \,dx \to \|D_N\|_{L_1}$ since $\|D_N\|_\infty \le 2N + 1$.  Thus, $\|\phi_N\| \ge \|D_N\|_{L_1}$ but $\|D_N\|_{L_1}$ grows faster than $c \log N$ by a result of Dirichlet.
\end{proof}

\p 3 Let $X$ be a normed space and $p: X \to \R$ be a sublinear functional. Show that 
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item There exists a linear functional $g : X \to \R$ such that 
$$ -p(-x) \le g(x) \le p(x), \quad \forall x \in X.$$
\item If $\|\cdot\|$ is a norm on $X$ and $f_n$ is a bounded sequence in $X^*$, there exists $f \in X^*$ such that 
$$\liminf_n f_n(x) \le f(x) \le \limsup_n f_n(x) , \quad \forall x \in X.$$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
Apply Hahn-Banach to the linear functional mapping $0 \in X$ to $0 \in \R$ to get a linear functional $g$ such that $g(x) \le p(x) \forall x \in X$.
-p(-x) \le p(x)

For (ii), 

\end{proof}




\p 4 Let $c_{00}$ be the space of sequences which are eventually $0$. Show that
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $c_{00}$ is dense in $c_0$.
\item $c_0$ is separable.
\item For every $x \in S_{c_0}$ there exists $x_1, x_2 \in S_{c_0}$ with $x_1 \neq x_2$  and $x = (x_1 + x_2)/2$.
\item $c, c_0$ are not isometrically isomorphic.
\item $c_0^*$ is isometrically isomorphic to $l_1$.
\item $c_0$ is not reflexive.
\item $c_0^*$ is isometrically isomorphic to $c^*$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item Let $\epsilon > 0$ and $x = (x_i) \in c_0$. Pick $N$ such that $\|x_i\| < \epsilon$ for all $i \ge N$. Let $y \in c_{00}$ be defined by $y_i = x_i$ for all $i \le N$ and $y_i = 0$ otherwise. Then $\|x - y\| < \epsilon$.

\item The space $c_{00}(\Q)$ is countable and dense in $c_{00}(\R)$, hence dense in $c_0(\R)$.

\item Let $x = (\xi_i) \in S_{c_0}$.  Pick any index $i$ such that $|\chi_i| < 1/2$.  Let $x_1 = x + (1/2) e_i$ and $x_2 = x - (1/2) e_i$.

\item Suppose $c, c_0$ are isometrically isomorphic.  Then $c$ has the property in (iii) also. Let $x = \sum_i e_i \in S_c$.  Pick $x_1, x_2 \in S_c$ with $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $x = (x_1 + x_2)/2$.  Let $j$ be an index such that $\pi_j(x_1) \neq \pi_j(x_2)$.  Since $\pi_j(x_1) + \pi_j(x_2) = 2$, one of $\pi_j(x_1)$ and $\pi_j(x_2)$ is greater than $1$. This contradicts the fact that $x_1, x_2 \in S_c$.

\item Define $T: l_1 \to c_0^*$ by $T((a_i)_{i=1}^\infty) = \sum_i a_i e_i^*$. This map is well-defined since each $e_i^* \in c_0^*$ is of norm 1, hence the series $\sum_i a_i e_i^*$ is absolutely convergent.   


% To see that $T$ is injective, note that if $a_i \neq 0$ for some $i$, then $T((a_i)_i)(e_i) = a_i \neq 0$.  Thus the kernel of $T$ is trivial, so $T$ is injective. 

%FIXME
To see that $T$ is surjective, let $f \in c_0^*$. I claim that $(f(e_i))_i$ is in $l_1$.  Suppose not. $\sum_i f(\sgn(f(e_i)) e_i) = \sum_i |f(e_i)|$

\item It was proved in class that $l_1^*$ is isometrically isomorphic to $l_\infty$.  Since $l_\infty$ is not separable but $c_0$ is separable, they are not homeomorphic.  Hence $c_0$ is not reflexive.

\item Define $T: c_0^* \to c^*$ by $T(f)((x_n)_n) = f((x_j - \lim_n x_n)_j)$. Then $T$ is well-defined and linear. If $f \in \ker(T)$ and $(x_n) \in c_0$, then $f((x_n)) = T(f)((x_n)) = 0$.  Hence $f$ is injective.



To see that $f$ is surjective, let $g \in c^*$. Then for any $(x_n) \in c_0$, we have $g((x_n)) = g((x_j - \lim_n x_n)_j) + g((\lim_n x_n)_j)$

\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}



\p 5 Let $X = (C^1[0,1], \|\cdot\|_\infty)$. Define $T : X \to C[0,1]$ by $Tf = f'$. Show that $T$ has a closed graph but is not bounded, implying that $C^1[0,1]$ is not Banach.

\begin{proof}
To see that $T$ has a closed graph,  suppose $(f_n, Tf_n) \to (f,g)$ in $X$.  Then $Tf_n \to g$ in the sup-norm, so $\lim_n Tf_n = g$ since $Tf_n$ are continuous.  Thus $T$ has a closed graph.

To see that $T$ is not bounded, let note that $\|\sin(nx)\| = 1$ but $\|T \sin(nx)\| = n$ for all $n \in \N$.

\end{proof}
