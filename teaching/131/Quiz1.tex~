1. A person will build a fence to enclose a rectangle of $2400$ square feet. The front of the fence is
made of a material priced at $\$20$ per linear foot. The other three sides are made of a material
priced at $\$12$ per foot of length. Find the cost of the fence as a function of the length of the
front.
\vfill
Steps: Draw the rectangle and label the side lengths as x or y.
\vfill
Find the cost as a function of the two variables x and y.
\vfill
Use the fact that the area is 2400 to eliminate one of the variables.
