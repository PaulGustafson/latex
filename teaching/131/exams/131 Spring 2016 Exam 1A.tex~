\question Jane notices that football game attendance is higher when the weather is warmer.  She finds that 100,000 fans attended a game when the temperature was $80^\circ$ and that 60,000 fans attended when the temperature was $40^\circ$.

\begin{answers}{3}
\ans $F(t) = 1000t+20,000$
\ans $F(t) = 1000t-40,000$

\question[11] Natalie believes that football teams that throw long passes tend to perform better.  She collects data on five football teams describing the longest pass the team throws during the season and the average number of points their football teams scored in a season.  The data is given in the table below.  Natalie wishes to construct a linear model representing this data set.\\
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
    \hline
    Longest Pass (yds) & Average Points \\ \hline \hline
    25 & 8.8  \\ \hline
    35 & 11.6  \\ \hline
    55 & 26.1  \\ \hline
    60 & 26.8  \\ \hline
    70 & 32.7  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

a.) (5 points) Find a linear model for this data set by \textbf{using the first and last points} in the table.
\vspace{2.00in}


b.) (3 points) Natalie enters the points into her calculator and computes that the linear regression line for her data is $P(x) = y = 0.558x - 6.1434$, where $x$ is the length of the longest pass a team throws and $P(x)$ is the average number of points scored per game.  Use her linear model to predict the average number of points a team would score whose longest pass is 45 yards.
\vspace{1.25in}

c.) (3 points) Use her model to predict the average number of points a team would score whose longest pass is 5 yards.  Is this a realistic prediction?  Why or why not?
