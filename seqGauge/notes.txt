The special Z_2 de-gauging of SO(8)_2

We get a modular category C(Z_8, q). What is q? Does de-equivariantization preserve twists? The de-equivariantization functor $F : C \to D$ with respect to a Tannakian subcategory T is defined as follows.  The category $D$ has the same objects as $C$ and $D(X,Y) = C(
