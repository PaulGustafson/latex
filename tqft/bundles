Let $G$ be a finite group.

A principle $G$-bundle is a fiber bundle $C \to X$ with each fiber a $G$-torsor.

A morphism of $G$-bundles over $X$ is a $G$-map from $C \to D$ that commutes with the projections.

WTS: the space of $G$-bundles over $X$ up to isomorphism is
$$\Hom(pi_1(X), G)/G$$
where the $G$ acts by conjugation.

Ideas: holonomy representation?
