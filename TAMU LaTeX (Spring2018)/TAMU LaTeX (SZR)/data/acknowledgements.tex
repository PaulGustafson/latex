\indent This thesis would not have been written without the guidance of my advisor, Eric Rowell.  I am also grateful to Zhenghan Wang and my father Robert Gustafson for their advice. 

I would also like to thank the Texas A\&M University Office of Graduate and Professional Studies and Sean Roberson for the \LaTeX\ thesis template used to construct this document.
