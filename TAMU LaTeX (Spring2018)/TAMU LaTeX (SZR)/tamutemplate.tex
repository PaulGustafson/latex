% Most of the packages that set the default settings
% for the document have moved to the style file
% tamuconfig.sty. This includes

%These next lines change the font. Fixes for certain
%fonts will be implemented in a future release.

%Comment this line if you do not wish to use Times
%New Roman. The font used will then be the LaTeX
%default of Computer Modern.
\usepackage{times}
%\usepackage{cmbright}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% For natbib-style references, uncomment this.
%\usepackage{natbib}

%This package allows for the use of graphics in the
%document.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%If you have JPEG format images, add .jpg as an
%allowed file extension below. Same for Bitmaps (.bmp).
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}

%It is best practice to keep all your pictures in
%one folder inside the main directory in which your
%TeX file is kept. Here the folder is named "graphic."
%Replace the name here with your folder's name, if needed.
%The period is needed due to relative referencing.
\graphicspath{ {./graphic/} }

% For quick document navigation.
