\subsection*{HW 7}
\p{1} Let $f(x) = e^{x}$ for $-\pi < x < \pi$.

a. Find the complex form of the Fourier series for $f$.

b. Sketch three periods of the $2\pi$-periodic function to which the series converges pointwise. (Hand-drawn is fine. No need to use a computer here.)

c. Find $\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac 1 {n^2 +1}$.

d. Estimate the error $\|f - S_N \|_{L_2[-\pi, \pi]}$, where $S_N$ is the partial sum of the Fourier series for $f$.


\p{2} Prove this:  Let $g$ be a $2 \pi$-periodic piecewise continuous function. Then, $\int_{-\pi+c}^{\pi + c} g(u) \, du$ is independent of $c$. (Remark: This holds for $g$ integrable on each bounded interval of $\R$.)


\p{3} Use the previous result to show that if $f$ is $2 \pi$-periodic and piecewise smooth, then it has the Fourier series f(x)∼a0+∑∞n=1cos(nx)+bnsin(nx), where
a0=12π∫2π0f(x)dx, an=1π∫2π0f(x)cos(nx)dx, bn=1π∫2π0f(x)sin(nx)dx,
Formulate a theorem on the pointwise convergence of the seires.

\p{4} Find the Fourier series for $f(x)=x$, $0<x<2 \pi$. Sketch three periods of the 2π-periodic function to which the series converges pointwise. (Hand-drawn is fine. No need to use a computer here.)
Find the Fourier series for f(x)={10x∈[−14π,14π],x∈(−π,14π) or x∈(14π,π).
Consider the series ∑∞n=−∞cneinx, where ∑∞n=−∞|cn|<∞. Show that the series ∑∞n=−∞cneinx converges uniformly to a 2π-periodic continuous function f(x) and the the series is the Fourier series for f. Also, show that the series converges to f in L2[−π,π].
