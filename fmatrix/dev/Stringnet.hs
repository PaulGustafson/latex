-- Represent the graph using an adjacency matrix with entries in Obj(A)
-- This matrix should be equal to its conjugate transpose.
-- We also need to keep track of the order of edges out of each vertex
-- along with the parenthesization.  This should be represented by a
-- binary tree whose leaves are the outgoing edges.
