\subsection*{HW 5}
\p{1} Let $(X, \mM)$ be a measurable space and $f_n : X \to \R$ be measurable for $n \in \N$. Show that 

a) $\liminf_{n \to \infty} f_n$ is measurable.

b) $\{x \in X : \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n \text{ exists } \} \in \mM$

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\p{2} Let $(X, \mM)$ and $(Y, \mN)$ be measure spaces. Assume that $\mu$ is a measure on $(X, \mM)$ and that $\phi: X \to Y$ is $(\mM, \mN)$ measurable. Then 
$$ \mu_\phi : \mN \to [0, \infty], \quad A \mapsto \mu(\phi^{-1}(A))$$
is a measure on $(Y, \mN)$. It is called the image of $\mu$ under $\phi$.

\p{3} Let $E \in \mL$. Then the set $E - E$ contains an open interval centered at 0.

\p{4} Let $(X , \mM, \mu)$ be a measure space. We call $A \in \mM$ an atom if $\mu(A) > 0$ and if $A = A_1 \cup A_2$ for $A_1, A_2 \in \mM$ disjoint implies that $\mu(A_1) = 0$ or $\mu(A_2) = 0$.

Assume now that $(X, \mM, \mu)$ is an atom-free measure space with $\mu(X) = 1$. Then there is for any $0 \le r \le 1$ an $A \in \mM$ with $\mu(A) = r$. Hint: first show that there is a measurable set whose measure is between 1/3 and 1/2. Secondly show that there is a disjoint sequence of measurable sets $(B_n)$ with $\mu(B_n) = 2^{-n}$. Write $r$ as $r = \sum_{n=1}^\infty r_n2^{-n}$ with $r_n \in \{0, 1\}$.  Therefore $\mu(\bigcup_{r_n=1} B_n = r$.

\p{5} Show that there is a measurable set $A \subset \R$ such that $0 < m(A\cap I) < m(I)$ for all nondegenerate intervals $I$.
