\begin{problem} (20 points) 
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]  
\item Find the multiplicative order $r$ of $13$ modulo $8633$, that is, the smallest exponent $r$ such that $13^r\equiv 1\pmod{8633}$.
\item Determine one or more factors of $8633$ by calculating 
$$ \gcd(13^{r/2}\pm 1, 8633).$$
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]  
\item I wrote a small python script to calculate this.  The result was $r = 1056$.
\item The results of the $\gcd$ calculations were $97$ and $89$, which are factors of $8633$.
\end{compactenum}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (10 points) 
Show that the order $r$ of a positive integer $a$ modulo $N$ cannot exceed $N$ assuming that $\gcd(a,N)=1$. In other words, show that the smallest positive integer exponent $r$ such that $a^r\equiv 1 \pmod N$ is bounded by $r\le N$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
I claim that $(a^k \pmod{N})_{k=0}^{r-1}$ are disjoint.  Suppose not. Then there exist $0 \le j< k < r$ such that $a^j = a^k$.  Hence $a^{k-j} = 1$.  Since $k - j < r$, the order of the group, this is a contradiction.

Since there are only $N$ disjoint elements mod $N$, this implies that $r \le N$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (10 points)
Calculate the convergents of $91/256$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The convergents are $\frac{0}{1}, 
\frac{1}{2}, 
\frac{1}{3}, 
\frac{5}{14}, 
\frac{11}{31}, 
\frac{16}{45}, 
\frac{91}{256}$.  

Here's a python script to calculate them:

\begin{verbatim}
a = 91
b = 256

#continued fraction expansion
def cfExp(p,q, cfE):
    if q == 0 :
        cfE = [p];
    else:
        cfExp(q, p - q*(p/q), cfE)
        cfE.insert(0, p/q)

cfE = []
cfExp(a, b, cfE)
print cfE

#Old convergents, initial conditions
p2 = 0
q2 = 1
p1 = 1
q1 = 0


for a in cfE:
    p = a*p1 + p2 
    q = a*q1 + q2
    print("\\frac{" + str(p) + "}{"  + str(q) + "}, ")
    p2 = p1
    q2 = q1
    p1 = p
    q1 = q
\end{verbatim}

\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (10 points) 
Recall that the convergents $p_k/q_k$ of a simple continued fraction satisfy the relation
$$ p_{k-1}q_k-q_{k-1}p_k = (-1)^k.$$
Deduce that the rational number $p_k/q_k$ is in reduced form, so $\gcd(p_k, q_k)=1$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The number $\gcd(a,b)$ is the least positive integer $k$ such that there exist integers $x,y$ such that
$ax + by = k$.  Multiply the given relation by $\pm 1$ to get the desired equality.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (20 points)
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Work out the steps of Shor's algorithm as given in the box on page 139-140 in our textbook assuming that you want to factor $N=129$ using $n=8$ qubits for $a=14$. Values such as $m_b$ should be determined. Typeset all the steps. 
\item Assuming the quantum part of Shor's algorithm would give you $6/256$. Could you determine the period $r$ of $a=14$ modulo $129$ from this observation. If so, how? 
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\begin{compactenum}[1.]
\item Create the state 
$$ \ket{\psi_0} = \sum_{x = 0}^{255} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \ket{x} \ket{14^x \pmod{129}}. $$
We can rewrite the above state as
$$ \ket{\psi_0} = \sum_{b = 0}^{41} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{z=0}^{m_b-1} \ket{42 z + b} \ket{14^x \pmod{129}}, $$
where $$m_b  = \left \lfloor \frac{255 - b  }{42} \right \rfloor + 1 = 
\begin{cases}
7 & b \le 3 \\
6 & b > 3
\end{cases}
$$
\item Measure the second register.  We measure $14^b \pmod{129}$ where $b$ is chosen almost uniformly at random from $\{0, 1, \ldots, r-1\}$.  Let's say the random value
was $b = 29$.  Then our measurement would be $74$, and $m_b = 6$, and the first register is in a superposition
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt 6} \sum_{z = 0}^5 \ket{42z + 29}.$$

\item We apply $\QFT_{2^n}^{-1}$ to the first register, and then measure a value $x$.  
\item The output is $x/256$. 
\end{compactenum}
Assuming the output was $6/256$, we know that there is a relatively high probability that $\left| \frac{6}{256} - \frac{j}{r} \right| \le \frac{1}{512}$ for some integer $0 \le j \le r-1$.  So, one checks for values of $r$ from the denominators of the convergents of $256$. The second convergent of $6/256$ is $1/42$, which would give you the correct value of $r$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (30 points) 
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Read Shor's paper on perusall.com and make at least 5 insightful comments. 
\item Study Shor's explanation of the probability to observe a given state starting from the state given in (5.4) until just before (5.11) on pages 17--18. Summarize this explanation in your own words. Be sure to capture the intution as well as the technical details. 
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The inputs are positive integers $x$ and $n$.  The problem is to find the least $r$ such that $x^r = 1 \pmod{n}$.  Let $q = 2^N$ be the least power of $2$ that is greater than or equal to $n^2$.  We requre $2N$ qubits.  The first $N$ qubits are grouped together into the first register, and the second $N$ qubits are the second register.  Assume all qubits are initialized into the state $\ket{0}$

We apply Hadamards to each qubit in the first register to put it into a uniform superposition of all the standard basis vectors, leaving the second register alone. We then calculate $x^a \pmod{n}$ for each vector $ket{a}\otimes \ket{0}$ in the superposition and put the result in the second register.  This is a reversible operation since the only non-hardcoded input is $a$ for each vector in the superposition, and $a$ is left alone. We then apply the discrete Fourier transform on the first register, giving us a superposition of states $\exp(2\pi i a c/q) \ket{c} \otimes \ket{x^a \pmod{n}}$, where $a,c$ range over all integers from $0$ to $2^N-1$.  

We then take a measurement of all the qubits.  The probability of measuring $\ket{c} \otimes \ket{x^a \pmod{n}}$, for some $0 \le a < r$, is
$$ \left| \frac{1}{q} \sum_{k: x^k = x^a \pmod{n}} \exp(2\pi i k c/q) \right|^2.$$ 
Since $r$ is the multplicative order of $x$, those $k$ are parametrized by $k = a + br$ for nonnegative integers $b$.  Thus, the above probability is equal to
$$ \left| \frac{1}{q} \sum_{b: a + br < q} \exp(2\pi i  b r c/q) \right|^2.$$ 

\newcommand{\rcq}{\{rcq\}_q}

Let $\rcq$ denote the representative of $rc$ mod $q$ such that $-q/2 \le \rcq \le q/2$.  When $\rcq \le r/2$,
 this sum is well-approximated (i.e. error with $O(1/q)$) by the integral
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{q} \int_{b:0 \le a + br < q}  \exp(2\pi i  b \rcq /q) \, db & = \frac{1}{r} \int_{u:0 \le a + qu < q}  \exp(2\pi i u \rcq /r) \, du \\
 & \approx \frac{1}{r} \int_{u:0 \le u < 1}  \exp(2\pi i  u \rcq /r) \, du,
\end{align*}
where the error in the last approximation is again $O(1/q)$.

Letting $\rcq$ vary between $-r/2$ to $r/2$, the last absolute value of the last integral is minimized at the endpoints $\pm r/2$ at 
a value of $2/(\pi r)$.  Thus, if $|\rcq| \le r/2$, the probability of measuring $\ket{c} \otimes \ket{x^a \pmod N}$ is 
$\frac{4}{\pi^2 r^2} + O(1/n^2)$.  Hence for sufficiently large $n$, this probability is greater than $\frac{1}{3r^2}$.
