States are described by positive matrices of trace 1.

A matrix $A \in M_n(\CC)$ is called positive if and only if it satisfies 
$v^* A V \ge 0$ for all $v \in \CC^n$  Equivalently, $A$ is hermitian
and all its eigenvalues are nonnegative.  Equivalently, there exists
some matrix $B$ s.t. $A = B^*B$.  Equivalently, $A$ is unitarily equivalent
to a diagonal, positive semidefinite matrix.
