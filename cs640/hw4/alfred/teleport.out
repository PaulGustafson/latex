Alice possesses the 2 most significant bits
Bob has the least significant bit
The initial state is
0.447|000)+0.894|100)
Alice and Bob share an EPR pair
on least 2 significant bits
0.316|000)+0.316|011)+0.632|100)+0.632|111)
Starting teleportation
Alice measures her bits and communicates the result to Bob
measured 1
measured 1
-0.894|110)+0.447|111)
Bob performs necessary operations and obtains
0.447|110)+0.894|111)
Alice resets her qubits into the ground state
Resulting state:
0.447|000)+0.894|001)
