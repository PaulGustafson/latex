\begin{problem}(20 points) 
  Consider a system of two quantum bits and a controlled-not gate
  $\lambda_{0,1}(X)$ that has the least significant bit as a control
  bit and acts on the most significant quantum bit. Dispel the myth
  that the control bit of the controlled-not gate remains
  unaffected. Specifically, describe the action of the controlled-not gate on the
  following four states:
$$ 
\ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{0_H}, \quad 
\ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{1_H}, \quad 
\ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{0_H}, \quad 
\ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{1_H},
$$
where 
$$ \ket{0_H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} +
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\quad\text{and}\quad
\ket{1_H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} -
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}.$$
Express the result in terms of the $\ket{0_H}$ and $\ket{1_H}$ basis.
