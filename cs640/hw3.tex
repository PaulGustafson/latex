\begin{problem}(10 points) 
Exercise 2.24 in the lecture notes. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
$$P(0) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt 5}{3}\right)^2 =  \frac{1}{9} + \frac{5}{9} = \frac{2}{3},$$
and
$$P(1) = \left(\frac{\sqrt 3}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.$$
The resulting states are
$$v_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt 6} \left| 00 \right\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{5}{6}} \left| 10 \right\rangle,$$
and
$$v_1 = \left| 01 \right\rangle.$$
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}(20 points) 
Exercise 2.26 in the lecture notes. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The quantum circuit begins by inserting a $\ket{0}$-valued qubit at the least significant position.
The resulting state is $\ket{0000}$.

Now apply (c) of problem 2.27.  At the end of this circuit, first three qubits are in the desired state.

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}(20 points)
Exercise 2.27 in the lecture notes. (a) Design the circuit, 
(b) prove the correctness of the
circuit and (c) show how to create the state. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
(a) Insert a qubit in the $\ket{0}$ state in the least significant position. Let's denote the position as
$-1$.  Then execute $\Lambda_{0,-1} \circ \Lambda_{1,-1} \circ \Lambda_{2,-1}$.

(b) Each controlled-not $\Lambda_{x,-1}$ flips the $-1$-bit iff the $x$-qubit has value $\ket{1}$.
In other words, if $v_i$ denotes the value of the $i$-th bit, then $\Lambda_{x,-1}$'s only effect
is to replaces $v_{-1}$ with $v_{-1} \oplus v_x$.
Hence, the final value of the $-1$-bit is
$0 \oplus x_2 \oplus x_1 \oplus x_0 = x_2 \oplus x_1 \oplus x_0$.

(c) Starting with $\ket{0000}$,  apply the map $H \otimes H \otimes H \otimes 1$.  
After this application, the state is a uniformly distributed superposition between $\ket{0}$ and
 $\ket{1}$ in the three most significant bits, and the state of the least
significant bit is $\ket{0}$.  

Apply the circuit in (a) to the three most significant bits, inserting the
new bit at position $-1$.  The state of the other four qubits remains unchanged, but the new
qubit is in state $\ket{0}$ if the first three qubits have even parity, and $\ket{1}$ otherwise.

Finally apply a $\Lambda_{-1, 1}$.  This turns the odd parity states into even parity states.  
By inspection, this gives the desired state in the most significant four qubits.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}(20 points)
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Exercise 6.1.1 (a) in the textbook KLM (should read Figure 6.1)
\item Exercise 6.1.1 (b) in the textbook KLM
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Since $U$ is unitary, $\overline U^T U = I$.  This means $\delta_{jk} = \sum_i \overline u_{ij}  u_{ik}$, i.e. that the
columns of $U$ are orthonormal.  Setting $k = j$, we get $1 = \sum_i |u_{ij}|^2$.
\item Any example given from (a) will have the rows summing to zero as well because the rows of a unitary matrix are orthonormal, too.  But this
doesn't have to be the case for a stochastic matrix of this type.  A counterexample is
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\end{compactenum}

\end{solution}


\begin{problem} (10 points)
Exercise 3.4 in the lecture notes. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Just write out where each basis vector goes and eyeball it.
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item If $f(x) = 0$, then the corresponding circuit is just the identity.
\item If $f(x) = 1$, then the corresponding circuit is $1 \otimes X$.
\item If $f(x) = x$, then the corresponding circuit is $\Lambda_{1,0}$.
\item If $f(x) = 1+x$, then the corresponding circuit is $(X \otimes 1) \Lambda_{1,0} (X \otimes 1)$.
\end{compactenum}
\end{solution}


\begin{problem}(20 points) 
  Consider a system of two quantum bits and a controlled-not gate
  $\lambda_{0,1}(X)$ that has the least significant bit as a control
  bit and acts on the most significant quantum bit. Dispel the myth
  that the control bit of the controlled-not gate remains
  unaffected. Specifically, describe the action of the controlled-not gate on the
  following four states:
$$ 
\ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{0_H}, \quad 
\ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{1_H}, \quad 
\ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{0_H}, \quad 
\ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{1_H},
$$
where 
$$ \ket{0_H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} +
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\quad\text{and}\quad
\ket{1_H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} -
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}.$$
Express the result in terms of the $\ket{0_H}$ and $\ket{1_H}$ basis. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The transition matrices from the $H$-basis to the standard basis and vice versa are both
$$S := \frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & -1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

In the standard basis,
$$\Lambda_{0,1} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Conjugating by the transition matrix gives 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Thus,
\begin{align*}
\Lambda_{0,1} (\ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{0_H}) & = \ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{0_H} \\ 
\Lambda_{0,1} (\ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{1_H}) & = \ket{0_H} \otimes \ket{1_H} \\
\Lambda_{0,1} (\ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{0_H}) & = \ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{1_H} \\
\Lambda_{0,1} (\ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{1_H}) & = \ket{1_H} \otimes \ket{0_H} 
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
