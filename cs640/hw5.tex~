\begin{problem} (20 points) 
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]  
\item Find the multiplicative order $r$ of $13$ modulo $8633$, that is, the smallest exponent $r$ such that $13^r\equiv 1\pmod{8633}$.
\item Determine one or more factors of $8633$ by calculating 
$$ \gcd(13^{r/2}\pm 1, 8633).$$
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (10 points) 
Show that the order $r$ of a positive integer $a$ modulo $N$ cannot exceed $N$ assuming that $\gcd(a,N)=1$. In other words, show that the smallest positive integer exponent $r$ such that $a^r\equiv 1 \pmod N$ is bounded by $r\le N$.

\begin{problem} (10 points)
Calculate the convergents of $91/256$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (10 points) 
Recall that the convergents $p_k/q_k$ of a simple continued fraction satisfy the relation
$$ p_{k-1}q_k-q_{k-1}p_k = (-1)^k.$$
Deduce that the rational number $p_k/q_k$ is in reduced form, so $\gcd(p_k, q_k)=1$. 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (20 points)
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Work out the steps of Shor's algorithm as given in the box on page 139-140 in our textbook assuming that you want to factor $N=129$ using $n=8$ qubits for $a=14$. Values such as $m_b$ should be determined. Typeset all the steps. 
\item Assuming the quantum part of Shor's algorithm would give you $6/256$. Could you determine the period $r$ of $a=14$ modulo $129$ from this observation. If so, how? 
\end{compactenum}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem} (30 points) 
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Read Shor's paper on perusall.com and make at least 5 insightful comments. 
\item Study Shor's explanation of the probability to observe a given state starting from the state given in (5.4) until just before (5.11) on pages 17--18. Summarize this explanation in your own words. Be sure to capture the intution as well as the technical details.
