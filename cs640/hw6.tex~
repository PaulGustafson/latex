\begin{problem}{(20 points)}
Consider the mixed state 
$$ M= \left\{ \left(\ket{0}, \frac{1}{3}\right), \left(\ket{1}, \frac{2}{3}\right)\right\}.$$
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item Determine the density matrix $\rho$ of the mixed state $M$. 
\item Derive a different mixed state $M'$ (which should not consist of
  computational basis states) that has the same density matrix
  $\rho$ as $M$. 
\end{compactenum}
[This problem shows that density matrices are not in one-to-one
correspondence with mixed states.]

\begin{problem}{(20 points)}
Find the Schmidt decomposition of the states 
\begin{compactenum}[(a)]
\item $ \frac{1}{2}\left( \ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10} + \ket{11}
  \right)$.
\item $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left( \ket{00} + \ket{01} + \ket{10}
  \right)$.

[Students of CSCE 440 only need to solve (a), and students of CSCE 640
should solve both (a) and (b).]

\begin{problem}{(20 points)}
Choi has shown that for all matrices $V_j\in \C^{n\times m}$, the map 
$T\colon M_n(\C) \rightarrow M_m(\C)$ given by 
$$ T(\rho)  = \sum_{j=1}^\ell V_j^* \rho V_j$$
is completely positive. Show that if the matrices $V_j$ satisfy the
condition
$$ \sum_{j=1}^\ell V_jV_j^* = I,$$
where $I$ denotes the identity matrix, then $T$ is trace preserving,
so $\tr T(A) = \tr A$. [Hint: the matrix trace satisfies $\tr(ABC)=\tr(CAB)$.]
