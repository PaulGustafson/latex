\subsection*{HW 3}
\p Prove that the roots systems for $\mf{so}(5)$ and $\mf{sp}(4)$ are isomorphic.

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\p Let $(R,E)$ be a roots system, with Weyl group $W$.  Show that $W$ is a normal subgroup of the group of automorphisms of $(R,E)$ (that is, the group of linear automorphisms of $E$, preserving $R$ as a set, and preserving the Cartan integers). 

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\p Fill in the details of the proofs of the results in 10.2 and 10.3 of Humphreys book.
