\subsection*{Section 1.3: Functors}
\p{1} Show how each of the following constructions can be regarded as a functor:
The field of quotients of an integral domain; the Lie algebra of a Lie group.
\begin{proof}
Let $A$ denote the category of integral domains and $B$ denote the category of fields.
Define the functor $F: A \to B$ by sending each integral domain to its field of fractions and
sending each morphism of integral domains $\phi: R \to S$ to $F(\phi):F(R) \to F(S)$ defined by
$F(\phi)(a/b)  = \phi(a)/\phi(b)$. (What if $\phi(b) = 0$???)  To see that $F(\phi)$ is a r

We need to check that $F$ sends id to id (true), and that $F(f \circ g) = F(f) \circ F(g)$ (true).
\end{proof}
