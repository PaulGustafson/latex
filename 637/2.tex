\subsection*{HW 2}
\p{3} Let a group $G$ act on a topological space $X$ by homeomorphisms.  Show that the projection $\pi: X \to G \backslash X$ is an open map.
 As a corollary show that  if $X$ is locally compact so is $G \backslash X$.
\begin{proof}
To see that $\pi$ is continuous, let $U \subset G \backslash X$ be open.  Then $\pi^{-1}(U) = GU \subset X$ is open by the definition of the topology on $G \backslash X$.

To see that $\pi$ is open, let $U \subset X$ be open.  Then $\bigcup_{x \in U} Gx = \bigcup_{g \in G} gU$ is open since the RHS is a union of open sets.  Thus $\pi(U)$ is open, so $\pi$ is an open map.

Suppose $X$ is locally compact.  Let $Gx \in G \backslash X$.  Pick a compact set $K \subset X$ with $x \in K$.  Then $\pi(K)$ is compact since it is the image of a compact set under a continuous map. 
\end{proof}

\p{4} Let a group $G$ act properly discontinuously on a locally compact, Hausdorff space $X$ by homeomorphisms.  Show that, for any two points $x, y \in X$, there exists an open set $U_x$ containing $x$ such that only finitely many elements of the orbit $Gy$ are in $U_x$.
As a corollary show that the orbit space $G \backslash X$ is Hausdorff.
\begin{proof}
Let $U_x$ be a precompact neighborhood of $x$.   Since the action of $G$ is properly discontinuous, $Gy \cap \overline U_x$ is finite.  Thus $Gy \cap U_x$ is finite. 

Furthermore, if $Gx \neq Gy$, we can intersect $U_x$ with open neighborhoods of $x$ separating $x$ from each point of $Gy \cap U_x$ to get a new neighborhood $V_x$ of $x$ such that $Gy \cap V_x = \emptyset$.

% To see that $G \backslash X$ is $T_1$ , it suffices to show that every point of $G \backslash X$ is closed.  Let $Gy \in G \backslash X$.  For every $x \in X$ with $Gx \neq Gy$, pick a neighborhood $V_x \subset X$ containing $x$ and with $Gy \cap V_x = \emptyset$. Then $Gy \cap \bigcup_{Gx \neq Gy} GV_x = \emptyset$. Hence $\{ Gy \}^c = \bigcup_{Gx \neq Gy} Gx$ is open, so $Gy$ is closed in $G \backslash X$.
\end{proof}
