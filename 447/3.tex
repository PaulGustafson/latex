\p{17.7} If $f: D\to \R$ is measurable and $g: \R \to \R$ is continuous, show that $g \circ f$ is measurable.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{11} Let $G \subset [0,1]$ be open, containing the interval rationals, and having $m(G) < 1/2$. Prove that $f = \chi_G$ is Borel measurable but cannot be equal a.e. to a Riemann integrable function.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{12} If $f : [a,b] \to \R$ is Lipschitz with constant $K$, and if $E \subset [a,b]$, show that $m^*(f(E)) \le K m^*(E)$. In particular, $f$ maps null sets to null sets.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{17} If $f,g: \R \to \R$ are Borel measurable, show that $f \circ g$ is Borel measurable. If $f$ is Borel measurable and $g$ is Lebesgue measurable, show that $f \circ g$ is Borel measurable.  If $f$ is Borel measurable and $g$ is Lebesgue measurable, show that $f \circ g$ is Lebesgue measurable.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{18(e)} Show that there is a Lebesgue measurable function $F$ and a continuous function $G$ such that $F \circ G$ is not Lebesgue measurable.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{37} Give an example showing that a. u. convergence does not imply uniform convergence a.e.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{40} If $f$ is Lebesgue measurable, prove that there is a Borel measurable function $g$ such that $f = g$ except, possibly, on a Borel set of measure zero. [Hint: Every null set is contained in a Borel set of measure zero.]
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{41} Let $E \subset \R$ be closed, and let $f:E\to \R$ be continuous. Prove that $f$ extends to a continuous function $g:\R\to\R$ with $\sup_\R |g| \le \sup_E |f|$.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{43} Let $f: [a,b] \to [-\infty,\infty]$ be a measurable and finite a.e., and let $\epsilon > 0$. Show that there is a polynomial $p$ such that $m\{|f - p| \ge \epsilon\} < \epsilon$.
\begin{proof} 
\end{proof}
\p{44} Let $f: [a,b] \to [-\infty,\infty]$ be a measurable and finite a.e. Prove that there is a sequence of polynomials $(g_n)$ on $[a,b]$ such that $g_n \to f$ a.e. on $[a,b]$. [Hint: For each $n$ choose $g_n$ so that $E_n = \{|f-g_n| \ge 2^-n\}$ has $m(E_n) < 2^-n$. Now argue that $g_n \to f$ off the set $E = \limsup_{n\to\infty} E_n$.]
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{45} Let $f: [a,b] \to [-\infty,\infty]$ be a measurable and finite a.e., and let $\epsilon >0$. Show that there is a continuous function $g$ on $[a,b]$ with $m\{f \ne g\} < \epsilon$. [Hint: Combine Exercises 41 and 44 and Egorov's theorem to find $(g_n)$ and a closed set $f$ with $m([a,b]\setminus F) < \epsilon$ and $g_n \to f$ uniformly on $F$. Now argue that $f|_F$ extends to a continuous function $g$.]
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{46} (Luzin's Theorem) Show that $f: \R\to\R$ is measurable if and only if, for each $\epsilon >0$, there is a measurable set $E$ with $m(E) < \epsilon$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $\R\setminus E$ is continuous.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{48} Show that there is a measurable set $K \subset [0,1]$ such that $\chi_K$ is everywhere discontinuous in $[0,1] \setminus N$ for any null set $N$.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
