\p{17.7} If $f: D\to \R$ is measurable and $g: \R \to \R$ is continuous, show that $g \circ f$ is measurable.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{11} Let $G \subset [0,1]$ be open, containing the interval rationals, and having $m(G) < 1/2$. Prove that $f = \chi_G$ is Borel measurable but cannot be equal a.e. to a Riemann integrable function.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{12} If $f : [a,b] \to \R$ is Lipschitz with constant $K$, and if $E \subset [a,b]$, show that $m^*(f(E)) \le K m^*(E)$. In particular, $f$ maps null sets to null sets.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{17} If $f,g: \R \t \R$ are Borel measurable, show that $f \circ g$ is Borel measurable. If $f$ is Borel measurable and $g$ is Lebesgue measurable, show that $f \circ g$ is Borel measurable.  If $f$ is Borel measurable and $g$ is Lebesgue measurable, show that $f \circ g$ is Lebesgue measurable.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{18(e)} Show that there is a Lebesgue measurable function $F$ and a continuous function $G$ such that $F \circ G$ is not Lebesgue measurable.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{37} Give an example showing that a. u. convergence does not imply uniform convergence a.e.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{40} If $f$ is Lebesgue measurable, prove that there is a Borel measurable function $g$ such that $f = g$ except, possibly, on a Borel set of measure zero. [Hint: Every null set is contained in a Borel set of measure zero.]
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{41} Let $E \subset \R$ be closed, and let $f:E\to \R$ be continuous. Prove that $f$ extends to a continuous function $g:\R\to\R$ with $sup_\R |g| \le sup_E |f|$.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\p{43} Let $f: [a,b] \to [-\infty,\infty]$ be a measurable and finite a.e., and let $\epsilon > 0$. Show that there is a polynomial $p$ such that $m\{|f - p| \ge \epsilon\} < \epsilon$.
\begin{proof}
