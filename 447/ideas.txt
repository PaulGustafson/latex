Measurable functions are the completion of simple functions (finitely many values) under pointwise convergence.

Similarly, the reals are the completion of the rational constant functions.

I think the completion of characteristic functions of open sets are the characteristic functions of measurable sets.

What about an intermediate idea? That is, what is the completion of simple functions only taking two values?
