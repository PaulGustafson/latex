\subsection*{HW 2}
\p{1.6} Contractible sets and hence convex sets are connected. 
\begin{proof}
Suppose not.  Then there exists a contractible space $X$ and a disconnection $X = U \cup V$. Let $x$ be a point for which $1_X \simeq c_x$. WLOG $x \in U$. Let $F:X \times I \to X$ be a homotopy from $1_x$ to $c_x$. 

Pick $y \in V$. Let $f(t) = F(y,t)$. Then by considering $f(I) \cap U$ and $f(I) \cap V$, we see that $f(I)$ is disconnected.  Hence $I$ is disconnected, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\p{1.8} \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Give an example of a continuous image of a contractible space that is not contractible.
\item Show that a retract of a contractible space is contractible.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
For (i), the circle is the image of the line under the winding map.

For (ii), let $X$ be contractible and $r: X \to Y$ be a retraction. Pick any $y \in Y$. Since $X$ is contractible, there exists $x \in X$ and  a homotopy  $F:1_X \simeq c_x$. 

Define $G: Y \times I \to Y$ by $G(y,t) = r(F(y,t))$. Then $G(y, 0) = r(F(y, 0)) = r(y) = y$, and $G(y, 1) = r(F(y,1)) = r(x)$.  Hence $G$ is a homotopy from $Y$ to $1_{r(x)}$.
\end{proof}



\p{1.9} If $f: X \to Y$ is nullhomotopic and if $g: Y \to Z$ is continuous, then $g \circ f$ is 
null-homotopic.

\p{1.10} Let $f:X \to Y$ be an identification, and let $g: Y \to Z$ be a continuous surjection.
Then $g$ is an identification iff $gf$ is an identification.

\p{1.11} Let $X$ and $Y$ be spaces with equivalence relations $\sim$ and $\square$, respectively, and
let $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous map preserving the relations (if $x \sim x'$, then $f(x) \square f(x')$).
Prove that the induced map $\overline f: X/\sim \to Y / \square$ is continuous; moreover, if
$f$ is an identification, then so is $\overline f$.
