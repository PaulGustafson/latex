\subsection*{HW 3}
\p{1.14} Prove that $X \mapsto CX$ defines a functor $\mathbf{Top}  \to \mathbf{Top}$. (Hint: exercise 1.11)

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\p{1.19} \begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item A space $X$ is path connected iff every two constant maps $X \to X$ are homotopic.
\item If $X$ is contractible and $Y$ is path connected, then any two continuous maps
$X \to Y$ are homotopic (and each is nullhomotopic).
\end{enumerate}

\p{1.23} 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item The $\sin(1/x)$ space $X$ has exactly two path components: the vertical line $A$ 
and the graph $G$.
\item Show that the graph $G$ is not closed. Conclude that, in contrast to componentes
(which are always closed), path components may not be closed.
\item Show that the natural map $\nu: X \to X/A$ is not an open map. (Hint: Let $U$
be the open disk with center $(0/\frac 1 2)$ and radius $\frac 1 4$; show that $\nu(X \cap U)$
is not open in $X/A (\approx [0, \frac 1 {2 \pi}])$.)
\end{enumerate}


\p{1.32} Assume that $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are spaces with $X \subset Y$.
