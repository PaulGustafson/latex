\subsection*{HW 3}
\p{1.14} Prove that $X \mapsto CX$ defines a functor $\mathbf{Top}  \to \mathbf{Top}$. (Hint: use exercise 1.11)
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\p{1.19} \begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item A space $X$ is path connected iff every two constant maps $X \to X$ are homotopic.
\item If $X$ is contractible and $Y$ is path connected, then any two continuous maps
$X \to Y$ are homotopic (and each is nullhomotopic).
\end{enumerate}

\p{1.23} 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item The $\sin(1/x)$ space $X$ has exactly two path components: the vertical line $A$ 
and the graph $G$.
\item Show that the graph $G$ is not closed. Conclude that, in contrast to componentes
(which are always closed), path components may not be closed.
\item Show that the natural map $\nu: X \to X/A$ is not an open map. (Hint: Let $U$
be the open disk with center $(0/\frac 1 2)$ and radius $\frac 1 4$; show that $\nu(X \cap U)$
is not open in $X/A (\approx [0, \frac 1 {2 \pi}])$.)
\end{enumerate}


\p{1.32} Assume that $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are spaces with $X \subset Y$. If $X$ is a retract, then 
every continuous map $f: X \to Z$ can be extended to a continuous map $\tilde f : Y \to Z$, 
namely, $\tilde f = fr$, where $r: Y \to X$ is a retraction. Prove that if $X$ is a retract of
$Y$ and if $f_0$ and $f_1$ are homotopic continuous maps $X \to Z$, then $\tilde f_0 \simeq \tilde f_1$.

\p{1.34} \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Define $i:X \to M_f$ by $i(x) = [x,0]$ and $j: Y \to M_f$ by $j(y) = [y]$. Show that
$i$ and $j$ are homeomorphisms to subspaces of $M_f$.
\item Define $r:M_f \to Y$ by $r[x,t] = f(x)$ for all $(x,t) \in X \times I$ and $r[y] = y$. Prove
that $r$ is a retraction $rj = 1_Y$.
\item Prove that $Y$ is a deformation retract of $M_f$. (Hint: Define $F:M_f \time I \to M_f$ by
\begin{array}[rcll]
F([x,t], s) & = & [x, (1-s)t+ s] & \text{ if } x \in X, t,s\in I; \\
F([y], s) & = & [y]  \text{ if } y \in Y, s \in I.)
\end{array}
\item Show that every continuous map $f: X \to Y$ is homotopic to $r \circ i$, where $i$ is
 an injection and $r$ is a homotopy equivalence.
\end{enumerate}
